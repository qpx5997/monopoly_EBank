# Monopoly EBank Manual
Written by plz4x

### (UNFINISHED, USE THE `manual` COMMAND FOR A GUIDE TO HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM)

# Part I: Introductory Chapters

## Chapter 1: Introduction
### About The Program
The Monopoly EBank is a command line interface that closely resembles the Monopoly Bank. The difference between the physical Bank and this program is that the EBank is entirely cashless and also has an infinite amount of money.

### Why This Program?
Whenever I play Monopoly, I have to turn off the fans and close the windows in the room so as to avoid the money flying around, making it sweltering hot inside. As for the air conditioner, I usually don't turn it on becuase it kind of was unnecessary i guess :/

It's also such a pain to count the money manually and give change and you know, stuff like that.

So I've created this program as a solution to these problems. Sure, other people obviously **have** created these sorts of programs before, but well I love programming and I want to try to make one myself.

And so there you have it. The purpose of this program, i guess.

### Why This Manual?
And by that I mean, why put the manual *here* instead of *in* the program itself?

Because readability.

There used to be a `manual` command in the CLI showing how to use the program, and a `help` command giving you a quick reference to the commands. However, they were a bit hard to read.

The manual looked something like this:

```
--snip--
1. COMMANDS FOR MANAGING MONEY
reset: Resets all player money to M1500.
add: Adds money to the stated player from the bank.
EXAMPLE: add p1 50 -- Gives M50 to p1
subt: Subtracts money to the stated plater. That money goes to the bank.
EXAMPLE: subt p1 50 -- Subtracts M50 from p1
go: Gives M200 to the stated player. Used as a shortcut from "add p1 200".
EXAMPLE: go p1 -- Gives M200 to p1
set: Sets the stated player's money to the stated amount.
EXAMPLE: set p1 300 -- Sets p1's amount to M300.
Press enter to continue or type "quit" to return to the CLI.
--snip--
```

It *is* rather readable, but I felt that it would be better to put the manual in a `.md` file, as these types of files present their text like a Wikipedia article.

So yeah.
